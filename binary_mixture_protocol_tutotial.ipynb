    "### In the protocol, I had defined two mixtures to make across 24 mole fractions. The print statements allow you to check if everything is working the way you want it to. We can see that we did indeed use the correct stocks, their concentrations, correct calculated volume, and how many wells we filled and where we are starting next. This should hopefully be pretty usedful. Note however, that these print statements will not appear if protocol is uploaded as a .py file in the GUI, the robot will only display explicit pipetting commands. So you can only use this to check your protocol beforehand in a jupyter notebook. To explicitly see the rest of the pipette transfer commands in the jupyter notebook as well, just uncomment  the robot.commands() for loop. "
